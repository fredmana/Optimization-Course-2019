# Optimization-Course-2019

This repository holds notebooks with my answers to the “Numerical Optimization with Applications” course given at BGU in Spring 2019.<br> 
Since github seems to be having issues rendering some of the Latex characters, I’ve also added HTML files which can be viewed after downloading.<br>
The final project, in which I implemented a residual (artificial) neural network, can be found in a separate repository.
